This is a boilerplate that I created using several software design patterns such as SOA, Repository, etc. It includes frontend and backend and it's fully functional. The example shows a simple employees database and a dashboard to create, read, update, delete them.
CORS is not configured and it's open for everyone. Security is sha1, JWT bearer token for auth. Endpoints are secured already.
Frontend techstack: bootstrap, VueJS, html5, css3, javascript
Backend techstack: .net 8.0, c#

Feel free to contact me for more information.
